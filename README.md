# Advent of Code 2023

My AoC 2023, mostly done in Scala to learn the language.

### Edit

I managed to keep track with the project all the way through day 17, but after that,
the Christmas preparation got most of my free time.

All in all, it was really a nice first stepping stone into Scala. I found it really easy to use, 
with the pros for me being the C-like syntax (or more Java-like should I say) and the fact 
that it is a nice to use functional language.  
It was my first real time dabbling with a language having a type-system so powerful, and it was
a learning curve.


### Original README


The code is quite messy and often under-optimised, but I don't really care, that's not the goal.


Running it through **Ammonite**:

```sh
amm -w day{x}.sc
```
